<h2>The Understanding the Atom Series</h2>
<p>Nuclear energy is playing a vital role in the life of every
man, woman, and child in the United States today. In the
years ahead it will affect increasingly all the peoples of the
earth. It is essential that all Americans gain an understanding
of this vital force if they are to discharge thoughtfully their
responsibilities as citizens and if they are to realize fully the
myriad benefits that nuclear energy offers them.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission provides
this booklet to help you achieve such understanding.</p>

<p><span class="lr">By NEAL O. HINES</span></p>
<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Mankind, increasingly crowding the earth, modifies the
earthly environment in uncounted subtle and unpredictable
ways, too rarely to the benefit of either earth or man. In
this century it has become critically important that we
comprehend more precisely than ever before the biological
mechanisms and balances of our environment and that we
learn to detect changes and to understand what they imply.</p>
<p>The release of atomic energy added a new dimension to
the possibility of environmental change. In man&rsquo;s first
experiments with atomic energy, he added small but perceptible
amounts of radioactivity to the earth&rsquo;s natural
total; as the Atomic Age matures, he inevitably will add
more. But, in the course of his experiments, man has come
to realize that environmental and biological studies, which
now are necessary because of the use of atomic energy,
may help solve not only the problems atomic energy creates
but also the larger problem of how to manage wisely the
world&rsquo;s limited natural resources.</p>
<p>This booklet describes the environmental investigations
that have been conducted with the aid of the atom since the
first atomic detonation near Alamogordo, New Mexico, in
1945. The earth&rsquo;s mysteries, however, are not easily unlocked,
and investigations of our environment with atomic
tools have only begun. The story thus is one of beginnings&mdash;but
of beginnings that point the way, it is hoped, to a new
understanding of the world in the atomic future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c2">SOME PRELIMINARY IDEAS</h2>
<p>Biologists are interested in every kind of living thing.
When they study organisms in relation to atomic radiations,
they enter the field of radiobiology, which really is not a
science in itself but merely a branch of the larger interest
in biology. Biologists find that atomic energy has significance
both in the study of individual organisms and in
studies of organisms in their natural communities and
habitats.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_3">
<img src="images/p003.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="389" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Skin-diving biologist collecting giant
clam from coral bottom of Bikini Lagoon in the Pacific Ocean.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Radioactivity introduced into any community may be
&ldquo;taken up&rdquo; by the biological system, becoming subject
to cycling in food chains or to accumulation in plant or
animal tissues. The presence of radioactivity permits study
of the workings of a system as large as an ocean, perhaps,
or of one no larger than a tree. And in each case it thus
may be possible to observe how the cycles of organic renewal
are related to the larger systems of life on earth.</p>
<h3>The Single Environment</h3>
<p>The environment in which we live is recognizable as a
single complex, composed of many subenvironments&mdash;land,
oceans, atmosphere, and the space beyond our envelope of
air. The deer in the forest, the lizard in the desert burrow,
and the peavine in the meadow are different kinds of organisms
living in situations that are seemingly unalike. Each
creature is part of its environment and a contributor to it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
but it also is part of the total biosphere.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> All creatures are
linked to each other, however remotely, in their dependence
on limited environments that together form the whole of
nature.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_4">
<img src="images/p004.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="386" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Gray shark photographed in another Pacific lagoon.</i></p>
</div>
<p>We know much about the life of the earth, but there is far
more that we do not know. Understanding of the large cyclical
forces has continued to elude us. We do not even yet
grasp the small and seemingly random biological relations
between individual organisms&mdash;relations involving predator
and prey, for instance, and those among species and
families&mdash;such as exist together in symbiotic<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> harmony
and interdependence. Through centuries of observation we
have gained a store of information. We are left, however,
with a still unsatisfied curiosity about the reach and
strength of the tenuous biological cords that bind together
the lives of the deer, the lizard, and the peavine.</p>
<h3>The Need to Understand</h3>
<p>Life on earth evolved amid constant exposure to ionizing<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
radiation, from the earth itself and from space, known as
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
background radiation. Therefore environmental studies
must be conducted in relation to, and with understanding of,
background radioactivity.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_5">
<img src="images/p005.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="355" />
<p class="caption small"><i>This Pacific Ocean coconut
crab, member of a family that usually sticks to tide-covered
beaches, depends on coconut trees for its food.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Of some 340 kinds of atoms that have been found in nature,
about 70 are radioactive. Three families of radioactive
isotopes<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>&mdash;the uranium, thorium, and actinium
series&mdash;produce a large proportion of the natural radiation.
Other radionuclides<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> occur singly, rather than in
families, and some of them, such as potassium-40 and
carbon-14, are major contributors of natural radioactivity.
Traces of natural radioactivity can be found, in fact, in all
substances on earth.</p>
<p>When man began experimenting with atomic fusion and
fission, he placed in his environment&mdash;across vast landscapes,
in the oceans, and in the atmosphere&mdash;measurable
additional amounts of radioactivity. These additions were
composed of the longer-lived members of some 200 kinds
of atomic radiation. Although the additions constituted but
a fraction of the background burden, they represented the
first alteration of the radiological balance that had existed
since the early ages of the planet. Thus it became necessary
to determine what the impact of such a change might
be. In the process of inquiry, these ideas emerged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>1.</b> The addition of man-made radioactivity presents the
possibility of delayed or cumulative effects. Long-term
studies, geared to the assessment of biological
effects from extremely low radioactivity, are essential.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p><b>2.</b> The addition of radioactivity makes possible broad-gauged
studies to trace the movement and concentration
of radionuclides in the environment. These
studies, in turn, can disclose new information on
biological complexes and mechanisms.</p>

<p>The quantities of low-level long-lived radioactivity already
released into our environment will provide materials
for future studies covering decades. Further, because
radioisotopes are chemically similar to nonradioactive
forms, observation of their biological fate will provide
clues to the transport, concentration, dilution, or elimination
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
of many other kinds of man-made toxic agents and

<p>Environmental problems are best approached in the
environment itself, where all the natural variables and
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
unknowns are present. Laboratory work is essential, but
no laboratory can carve from nature or reproduce artificially
all the complexities of the natural environmental
&ldquo;laboratory&rdquo;, the ecosystem.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Environmental studies frequently demand the coordinated
attentions of ecologists,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> chemists, physicists, geologists,
oceanographers, meteorologists, botanists, zoologists, and
others, all working together to approach the environment
as a synchronized mechanism.</p>
<p>Finally, environmental studies are conducted with a
special consciousness of the need to withhold judgment as
to what is meant by &ldquo;effect&rdquo;, particularly &ldquo;radiation effect&rdquo;.
Gross, immediate effects may be determinable. Ultimate
effects may be generations in the making, remote in time
and space from their causes. Studies thus are focused on
biological processes and on isolation and identification of
the long-range trends.</p>

<h2 id="c3">A VIEW IN PERSPECTIVE, 1946-1963</h2>
<p>Bikini Atoll, in the Marshall Islands, represents, in
miniature, a world that has experienced all the forces,
immediate and residual, that can result from nuclear detonation.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p009.jpg" alt="NORTHERN MARSHALL ISLANDS" width="500" height="301" />
</div>
<p>Bikini in 1946 was the scene of the first peacetime tests
of atomic weapons. One of these tests involved the detonation
of an atomic device under water, in the heart of the
atoll&rsquo;s aquatic circulatory system. Bikini also was used
for 5 years, from 1954 through 1958, for the testing of
thermonuclear<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> devices. Its islands and reefs were burned
by atomic heat, and the waters of its lagoon were contaminated
by deposits of radioactive fallout. Thus, for almost
a score of years, Bikini, a small outcropping of coral in
the mid-Pacific, was identified with the earliest experiments
in nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>Through the years of testing and later, Bikini also was
the site of repeated biological investigations. Teams of
scientists examined Bikini annually from 1946 to 1950 and
from 1954 to 1958. Then in 1964, after an interlude of
6 years in which Bikini was undisturbed either by weapons
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
tests or human visitors, scientists went there again to
make a comprehensive ecological resurvey.</p>
<p>The scientists found in the Bikini ecosystem, in low but
perceptible amounts, residual traces of radioactivity deposited
by the tests. On certain islands, craters dug by
nuclear explosions still gaped in the reefs. The test islands
still bore nuclear scars, and in some areas of the lagoon
corals and algae had been killed by silt stirred up by the
detonations. But Bikini&rsquo;s life system clearly was in a process
of healing. Large islands were covered by regrowths
of vegetation; on some, the masses of morning glory, beach
magnolia and pandanus were growing so densely that field
parties had extreme difficulty cutting paths through them.
Bikini Atoll, scientists believed, needed only clearing and
cultivation to make it once again suitable for human habitation.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_9">

<p class="caption small"><i>Autoradiograph of a plankton sample collected

</div>
<p>What, then, may be concluded from the Bikini case? A
final answer still cannot be phrased. It is not a conclusion
to say that nature and time have permitted recovery, reassuring
though such knowledge may be. It becomes important
to know the processes of recovery. Meantime, it is
helpful to examine the Bikini case in the context of developments
during the period from the end of World War II to the
signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963.</p>
<h3>The Bikini Tests of 1946</h3>
<p>The early period of nuclear testing in the atmosphere
was a time that will not be seen again. It was the beginning
of an era of unparalleled scientific activity and of worldwide
emotional and intellectual adjustment to the knowledge
that power of unimaginable magnitude, locked in the nucleus
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the atom since the creation of the world, now could be
released at will.</p>
<p>When World War II was ended, the impulse to test the
new power was irresistible. There was profound curiosity
about the revolutionary nature of the new force. There was
a perplexed and fearful realization that the release of
energy would have to be guarded and controlled. There was
the knowledge that nuclear fission produced a miscellany
of radioactive products presenting unexplored possibilities
of hazard. The word &ldquo;fallout&rdquo; was coined to describe the
deposition on the earth of radioactive debris from nuclear
explosions.</p>
<h4>Joint Task Force One</h4>
<p>The first peacetime nuclear tests,
conducted at Bikini in 1946 in a military-scientific exercise
designated Operation Crossroads, were designed to
assess the effects of nuclear weapons on naval vessels. The
test organization, Joint Task Force One, an adaptation of
the wartime joint task force combat concept, was a massive
waterborne force including 42,000 members of the armed
services, civilian scientists, consultants, and observers.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_10">
<img src="images/p011.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="701" />
<p class="caption small"><i>The Bikini Lagoon before testing.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Bikini Atoll was selected for the tests because, among
other things, it was remote from heavily populated areas,
it offered a protected anchorage, and it had the relatively
stable and predictable meteorological and oceanographic
conditions considered essential to operations in which the
unknowns loomed so large. Three test detonations originally
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
were projected; two ultimately were carried out. The first,
Test Able, was an airdrop of an atomic bomb on July 1,
1946, over a test fleet of 70 ships anchored in Bikini Lagoon.
The second, Test Baker, was the detonation on July 25
of an atomic device suspended in the lagoon 90 feet below
a small target vessel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p012.jpg" alt="OPERATION CROSSROADS: The Approximate Position of the Target Area of the 1946 Test Detonations" width="500" height="305" />
</div>
<h4>Scientific Interests</h4>
<p>Although Crossroads was a military
program, the mobilization of scientific interests was in
many ways of historic proportions. For months before the
explosions, oceanographers studied the waters and the
structure of the mid-Pacific basin and meteorologists the
winds and upper airs. Geologists, zoologists, botanists, and
other specialists examined the atoll in detail. Bikini became,
as it remains to this day, one of the most thoroughly
familiar ocean structures in the world.</p>
<p>There was awareness, even then, of the significance of
radioactivity as an element of nuclear effect. The task
force made elaborate preparations to assure the safety of
personnel and sent to the atoll thousands of radiation-detection
instruments. Plans were made to observe the
effects of radioactivity on test animals placed on ships of
the target fleet.</p>
<h4>The Underwater Detonation</h4>
<p>The first of the Bikini events,
Test Able, the explosion of a bomb dropped from an aircraft
over the target fleet, sank a number of major vessels,
left others sinking or crippled, contaminated many
with radiation, and laid a plume of fallout northward over
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
the rim of the atoll into the waters of the ocean. It was Test
Baker, however, the underwater explosion, that would make
Bikini the subject of radiobiological investigations for many
years.</p>
<p>The Baker test was the first occasion in which nuclear
debris was mixed with water and ocean sludge and returned
to the area of detonation. The explosive device was of what
later would be called nominal size, its force equivalent to
20,000 tons of TNT. The test still is regarded as a classic
demonstration of the phenomena of shallow-water atomic
explosion.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_11">
<img src="images/p013.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="541" />
<p class="caption small"><i>The Baker Test. A cauliflower-shaped cloud, after dumping one
million tons of water that had been sucked up by the explosion,
rises over the target warships, silhouetted in front of the spreading
base surge.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>At the moment of release, the surface water of the lagoon
was first lifted and then penetrated by a lighted bubble
that vanished in seconds in a hollow column of water of
gigantic dimensions&mdash;a column 2000 feet in diameter (its
walls 300 feet thick) rising to a height of 6000 feet and
containing 1,000,000 tons of water. At the base of the column,
foam was churned upward for several hundred feet,
and, moving out from the base, as the column sank back
into the lagoon, surged a monstrous wave initially more
than 80 feet high.</p>
<p>Radioactivity in the water was intense. The immediate
total was described as equal to &ldquo;many hundred tons of
radium&rdquo;. Decay and dilution of radioactive materials
quickly reduced the total radioactivity. After 3 days, by
which time water contamination had spread over an area of
50 square miles, the dose rate from the water was well
within safe limits for persons remaining for brief periods.
Yet it was several more days before inspection and scientific
parties could spend useful time among the surviving
target vessels.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the lagoon, below the point of detonation,
Navy divers months later found that the explosion had
scooped out thousands of tons of mud and coral sediment,
creating a shallow basin half a mile wide. This basin, in
the slow settling of returning sludge, became an area from
which long-lived radioactivity entered Bikini&rsquo;s biological
system.</p>
<h4>First Assessments</h4>
<p>In 3 weeks of final work after Test
Baker, the Bikini scientific teams took from the islands
and the lagoon many hundreds of samples of plants, corals,
crabs, fish, plankton, and water. They noted that radioactivity
was present in all samples taken from every part
of the atoll, which indicated an early uptake of radionuclides
by the biota<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> and suggested that there was a continuing
circulation of radioactive debris in the water. They took
samples of fish in the open ocean outside the atoll and made
comparative collections at other atolls. The instruments
and techniques for analyzing radioactivity were far from
refined, but all available evidence pointed to the need for
more particular efforts to examine radiobiological results.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3>The Bikini Resurvey of 1947</h3>
<p>A resurvey of Bikini, the first of many, was conducted
with heavy radioenvironmental emphasis in July 1947, a
year after the Crossroads tests. The scientific expedition
was supported by 2 vessels and included 70 scientists and
several hundred Navy personnel.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_12">
<img src="images/p014.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="353" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Bikini Beach as it appeared
in the years after Operation
Crossroads.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The resurvey group, entering an oceanic environment
that had been completely undisturbed for nearly a year,
established at once that traces of residual radioactivity
still were cycling in Bikini&rsquo;s ecosystem. For 6 weeks the
scientists probed every realm of the atoll environment,
sampling biota, making inventories of plant and animal
communities, and obtaining core samples from the lagoon
floor. When the data had been assembled and reviewed and
the reports filed, months later, there was consensus that
Bikini had produced no evidence that radioactivity, as a
separate and identifiable factor, was having any immediate
effect on the health of the atoll, and probably no cumulative
effect, either.</p>
<p>There were, of course, unknowns. So long as radioactivity
remained in the biological cycles there were possibilities
of future developments. In 1947 no other place on earth
offered an opportunity to observe the natural processes by
which radiation contamination is eliminated from an environment.
It therefore seemed prudent to compile a longer
record, consisting of other, purely radiobiological surveys
at Bikini.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>By 1947 the new U. S. Atomic Energy Commission had
taken over from the wartime Manhattan Engineering District
the management of the national effort in the field of
atomic energy. A primary responsibility of the AEC in that
period was to press ahead with nuclear weapons development,
but the agency also had specific obligations and interests
in the fields of biology and medicine. Meantime,
the testing of nuclear weapons had been started at a new
proving ground at Eniwetok Atoll, 190 nautical miles west
of Bikini.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_13">
<img src="images/p015.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="410" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Islands on the rim of Eniwetok Atoll, as they appear

vegetation is apparent. Note extent of the reef on both sides of islands.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>Studies at Nuclear Test Sites, 1948-1958</h3>
<p>The first test series at Eniwetok, Operation Sandstone
(1948), incorporated no formal radiobiological studies, but
radiobiologists visiting Bikini also made surveys at Eniwetok
in 1948 and 1949. Then, for a time, world events
intervened. The detonation of an atomic device by the
U.S.S.R. in 1949 was followed in 1950 by the outbreak of the
Korean War, and these events produced a national mood
oriented toward national defense. By 1951, because events
in the Pacific had interrupted tests there, the Atomic
Energy Commission had established a continental test site
in Nevada. In that year, too, tests were made at Eniwetok
preliminary to the detonation of the first thermonuclear
device.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>After 1951 each of the test programs had its radiobiological
component. In the Pacific, radiobiological surveys
were associated with Operation Ivy (1952), Operation
Castle (1954), Operation Redwing (1956), and Operation
Hardtack (1958). A small field station, the Eniwetok Marine
Biology Laboratory, was established for use by scientists
conducting biological studies. Bikini was incorporated
into the Pacific Proving Ground in 1953, and new
biological surveys were performed there in connection with
the tests of 1954 and later.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_14">

<p class="caption small"><i>The Eniwetok Marine Biology Laboratory. Monument at
right commemorates the battle for Eniwetok in World War II.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In these years, 1951 to 1958, the U.S.S.R. was testing
nuclear weapons, as was Great Britain after 1952. Fallout
from these contributed to the total of man-made radioactivity
potentially available to the environments of the
world.</p>
<h3>Landmarks</h3>
<p>The years between the establishment of the Pacific
Proving Ground and the signing of the 1958 nuclear test
moratorium were years in which the quest for environmental
information could not keep pace with the rapid
growth of nuclear capability. But the growth in the field of
weapons served to underline the need for information and
produced certain landmark developments in environmental
research.</p>
<p>The detonation of the first thermonuclear device projected
the problem of environmental contamination to the stratosphere
and, literally, to every part of the earth. This explosion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Test Mike, largest on earth to that time, was set
off on Elujelab Island, on the north rim of Eniwetok Atoll,
on November 1, 1952. In the reef where Elujelab had been,
the blast left a crater almost a mile in diameter and 200
feet deep. The towering nuclear cloud rose in 15 minutes
to a height of 130,000 feet.</p>
<p>Test Mike marked a point of change. Before, fallout from
nuclear detonation had been principally local, touching the
waters and reefs of an atoll or a desert landscape. After
Test Mike, the implications of fallout obviously were global.</p>
<p>A mishap in connection with a 1954 thermonuclear test
at Bikini contributed in two important ways to the enlargement
of environmental investigations. Fallout from the test,
swept off its predicted pattern by unexpected winds at high
altitudes, deposited debris on Rongelap, an inhabited atoll
east of Bikini, and on fishermen aboard a Japanese vessel
operating in the Bikini-Rongelap area. The accident, unfortunate
in its consequences at Rongelap and in Japan, had
other results of even wider impact. From it came the first
international approaches to the problems of ocean contamination
and, later, long-term bioenvironmental studies
at Rongelap itself.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_15">
<img src="images/p017.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="318" />
<p class="caption small"><i>School of surgeonfish off

</div>
<p>Wide-ranging studies of ocean-borne radioactivity were
initiated by the Japanese. The experience of the fishermen
produced in Japan a fear of contamination of fisheries resources
as a result of the United States tests. One result
was the organization, in the summer of 1954, of a government-sponsored
ocean survey expedition that cruised from
Japan into and through the Bikini-Eniwetok area to determine
what amounts of radioactivity were being carried, by
water and by aquatic organisms, toward the shores of Japan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The expedition made significant observations of the role
of plankton<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> in the biological utilization of ocean fallout. A
United States scientific team, following up the Japanese
effort, made a similar but far more extensive cruise
through the Western Pacific early in 1955 and went on to
Japan to discuss its findings with the Japanese. During and
after the test series in the Pacific in 1956 and 1958, United
States surveys of the ocean were made routinely. Exchanges
of information between scientists of Japan and the
United States continued.</p>
<p>The Rongelap case produced results of another kind. The
Rongelap people were found to have suffered exposure
requiring medical attention and continued observation.
Evacuated from their atoll because it was not safe, members
of the community were given care at other atolls until
they could be repatriated in 1957, and received continued
medical supervision thereafter.</p>
<p>The bioenvironmental condition of Rongelap was unique.
The fallout had made the atoll the only place in the world
contaminated on a single occasion by relatively heavy deposition
of radioactive debris without also being disturbed
by a nuclear explosion. In 1957-1958, after the Rongelapese
had been returned to a new village constructed on their
atoll, Rongelap was the site of a long and thorough study of
the circulation of radionuclides in the terrestrial-aquatic
environment.</p>
<h3>Before the 1963 Test Ban Treaty</h3>
<p>The first break in the pattern of nuclear testing came in
1958, when the nuclear powers agreed to a 1-year test
moratorium. The world&rsquo;s political and emotional climates
were changing. For more than 5 years, the United States,
which had announced its Atoms-for-Peace Program in
December 1953, had been endeavoring to place emphasis
on the use of atomic energy for constructive purposes. The
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, liberalizing provisions of the
1946 law, contemplated for the first time private development
of nuclear power resources and established authority
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
for international activities. In 1957 the Atomic Energy
Commission initiated its Plowshare Program for the development
of peaceful uses of nuclear explosives.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="pic_16">
<img src="images/p018.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="640" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Distribution of fallout radioisotopes on Rongelap Atoll as determined
by a survey in 1961. Note the interrelationships of man,
plants, animals and the environment.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Amid such changes there was arising, too, a wider apprehension
concerning the possible effects of fallout. The
United Nations in 1955 appointed a committee of scientific
representatives of 15 nations to study the effects of radiation
on man. In the United States the National Academy of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Sciences published in 1956 the first of its summary reports
on the biological effects of atomic radiation.</p>
<p>Nuclear testing was not ended by the 1958 agreement,
yet the moratorium&mdash;which was renewed annually until
1961, when the U.S.S.R. broke the agreement by initiating
a new test series&mdash;was significant as an experiment in
nuclear restraint. After the United States conducted a final
test series near Christmas Island in 1962, new discussions
of ways to halt successive rounds of nuclear test programs
were held. Finally, in 1963, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
was signed by most of the nations of the world. The treaty
was, among other things, a declaration against worldwide
fallout.</p>
<h2 id="c4">THE ATOM IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES</h2>
<p>Although his experience with radioactivity has been brief,
man probably already knows more about the effects of radiation
than he knows about the effects of many other contaminants
that alter his environment. Even so, he knows
far less than he needs to know to make certain that atomic
energy is wisely managed in the future.</p>
<p>There has been neither time nor opportunity, for example,
to gather radiation-effects data on more than a few
hundred of the 1,500,000 kinds of living organisms inhabiting
the earth. Nor is it possible to predict the extent to
which life can adjust itself to environmental changes resulting
from scarcely perceptible alterations of natural
radiological balances. Also undetermined is the relation
between environmental changes and the biological exchanges
making up the often mentioned, but insufficiently understood,
&ldquo;balance of nature&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The case of carbon-14 is an example of a permanent
man-made modification of the environment. From the early
ages of the earth, carbon-14 has been created in the upper
atmosphere by the transmutation of nitrogen in cosmic-ray
reactions. Carbon itself is an almost universal component
of living matter, and the ratio between stable carbon and
radioactive carbon is believed to have been unchanged for
thousands of years. It is this circumstance that permits the
use of carbon-14 as a tool for &ldquo;dating&rdquo;, or determining the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
ages of, fossil remains, prehistoric artifacts, and geologic
formations. But carbon-14 also is produced in nuclear fusion,
and the testing of thermonuclear devices after 1952
produced an estimated increase of 4% in the amount of
carbon-14 on earth. This is enough to disturb the natural
equilibrium. Since the half-life<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> of carbon-14 is some 5800
years, the addition will be a factor of environmental consideration
for scores of human generations.</p>
<p>Nuclear tests, although not the only sources of man-made
radioactivity, have been until now the most significant
ones and the only sources touching large areas of the earth.
The total product of nuclear testing is small in relation to
the natural burden of radioactivity, raising the level of radiation
to which all life is subject by a factor of one-tenth
or less. But it is the unknown element, the degree to which
fallout radioactivity may introduce new influences into the
environment, that gives concern.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="pic_17">

</div>
<p>When a nuclear device is detonated, the release of energy
is due to the fission of uranium or plutonium atoms or to
the fusion of hydrogen atoms. At the instant of fission,
some 75 radionuclides, or fission products, are created.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>From these primary fission products, about 100 other radionuclides
may be formed, some existing only for microseconds
and others for thousands of years. The radionuclides
of significance to biologists are those that exist long
enough&mdash;no matter how brief the time&mdash;to have an impact
on a biological system.</p>
<p>Factors of biological transport and concentration of long-lived
radionuclides make efforts to assess possible environmental
effects particularly difficult. It has been asserted,
for example, that probably every living cell formed
since the early 1950s contains some of the radionuclides
produced by nuclear testing. No one knows the significance
of such a condition, if it indeed exists. It is certain only
that some of the long-lived radionuclides already placed in
the environment will be detectable there for hundreds of
years and hence will continue to provide material for biological
studies.</p>
<h3>Examining Environments</h3>

</div>
<p>When radioactivity is injected randomly into the atmosphere
by a nuclear detonation, biological disposition begins
in many ways, each related to the character of the explosion
and the environment in which it occurs. Fallout studies
thus involve the tracing of mixed fission products in the
biosphere and the collection and analysis of thousands of
samples of plant and animal tissue, and usually of water
and soils, at many successive times. The radiobiologist
then attempts to interpret the accumulated evidence of
uptake of radionuclides. Some fallout studies may require
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
sampling over large areas of the earth. Other investigations
of fallout or of radioisotopes introduced deliberately into
controlled field plots may require years of patient observation
in small and circumscribed areas.</p>

<p>Studies of ocean fallout, for example, have ranged over
hundreds of thousands of square miles of open water. The
1955 United States survey of the Western Pacific was conducted
by a scientific team aboard a Coast Guard vessel,
the <i>Roger B. Taney</i>, in a program called Operation Troll.
In 7 weeks the team cruised 17,500 miles, making collections
of water and marine organisms at 86 ocean stations
on a route extending from the Marshall Islands through the
Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands to the Philippines
and finally to Tokyo. The expedition took samples of
plankton at depths down to 200 meters and water from the
surface down to depths of 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 meters.</p>
<p>Environmental studies at nuclear test sites or in controlled
ecosystems involve not only long-term, periodic
sampling of plants and animals but also years of detailed
examination of soils, meteorological conditions, and other
factors.</p>

<p>In programs of such scope and duration, the problems of
interpretation are great. Broadly, environmental studies
give consideration to:</p>
<p>1. The amounts and kinds of radioactivity released to the
environment.</p>
<p>2. The rates of uptake by the biological system.</p>
<p>3. The amounts and kinds of radioactivity within the system.</p>
<p>4. The rates of metabolic transfer or elimination.</p>
<p>5. The amounts and kinds of radioactivity concentrated
in tissue and acting internally.</p>
<p>6. The time required for biological processes to be completed
and for any biological effects to develop.</p>
<h3>Biological Inventories</h3>
<p>Familiarity with the biological components of an ecosystem
is essential to meaningful radiobiological assessment.</p>
<p>Inventories of natural components were not made in the
early nuclear test programs because of inadequate realization
of the biological potential. Later, they could be made
only after radionuclides already had been introduced into
the environments.</p>
<p>The survey of the mid-Pacific region before Operation
Crossroads represented the earliest effort to examine an
environment in detail before a nuclear detonation, but was
designed so that it had only inferential value for other
long-range biological research. The test surveys were
useful, however, in expanding knowledge of specific environments.
In addition, it was standard practice to make
comparative collections of organisms in regions removed
from the test sites to establish base lines, or &ldquo;controls&rdquo;,
against which to measure radiobiological developments.</p>
<p>The most extensive inventory of an environment&mdash;an inventory
designed specifically in relation to an anticipated
nuclear detonation&mdash;was that made between 1959 and 1962,
as a preliminary phase of Project Chariot, in the Cape
Thompson area of Northwest Alaska. Chariot was a part of
the AEC Plowshare Program in which it was proposed to
excavate a harbor at the mouth of the Ogotoruk Creek,
which empties into the Chukchi Sea. Although the excavation
project actually never was undertaken, the &ldquo;predetonation&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
environmental investigations involved 3 years of coordinated
research into the climatic, marine, coastal, and terrestrial
aspects of the region, and detailed studies of the history and
the radiological and ecological situations of the human population.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_25">

<p class="caption small"><i>Taking a soil sample for
the Project Chariot biological
inventory to determine
kinds and relative abundance

other soil organisms.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The program was an effort to make a model environmental
inventory. Its significance was both in its assessment
of the base for determining the &ldquo;biological cost&rdquo; of the
proposed operation and in the thoroughness of its documentation
of the environmental features of a part of the world
that previously had been virtually unexplored. It was a
prototype for future studies.</p>
<h3>Measurements and Interpretations</h3>
<p>Determination of the amounts and kinds of radioactivity
in a biological sample is a process wholly dependent on instruments,
since radiation usually cannot be detected by
the senses.</p>
<p>A biological sample is any material of measurable biological
significance. A sample of tissue or similar organic
material usually is dried or reduced to ash in a muffle
furnace before it is examined with a radiation counting
device.</p>
<p>Improved instruments now permit the counting of radioactivity
at levels so low as to have been imperceptible a
few years ago. The samples, placed in lead chambers for
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
maximum shielding from background radiations, are examined
by multichannel analyzers capable of recording
radiation emissions continuously over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Data-processing techniques have been employed in the
handling and interpretation of information from long-range
biological sampling and analysis programs. Analog computers
have been used experimentally for theoretical projections
of results.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_26">
<img src="images/p029.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="473" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Instruments record radiation,
weather, sunlight, and other factors
transmitted from remote
sensors to this data center established
for a long-range terrestrial
ecology study program.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Scientists at the AEC&rsquo;s Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
for example, have developed experiments in which an analog
computer is programmed to keep a running balance of the
net changes&mdash;simultaneous gains and losses&mdash;of radioactivity
in the various compartments of a representative
ecosystem. The computer becomes an electronic image of
the biosphere, using known or assumed rates of energy
transfer and photosynthesis to predict probable radiological
results of tracer experiments of environmental contamination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c5">ENVIRONMENTS&mdash;SINGULAR, YET PARTS OF A WHOLE</h2>
<p>Each environment presents its own sets of conditions and
unknowns. It is important to appreciate those that are
characteristic of water, land, and atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Aquatic Systems</h3>
<p>The oceans are the basins into which are poured all the
nutrients or wastes transported from the land by rivers
and winds.</p>
<p>The difficulty of determining the fate of radionuclides in
aquatic systems is complicated by chemical and biological
differences within the system and by the variety and scope
of the circulatory mechanisms. In oceans the sheer immensity
of the water volume usually makes observation
superficial or fragmentary. Rivers present great differences
in flow, and lakes vary in internal dynamics. Above
all, an ocean, a river, or a lake is an area of constant physical
and biological motion and change. In the ocean the surface
waters form a theater of kaleidoscopic, and frequently
violent, action. The presence of man-made radioactivity in
water has made it possible to follow the disposition of
nutrients and wastes in the restless aquatic ecosystem.</p>
<h4>Biological Uptake</h4>
<p>In a water environment the minerals
necessary to life are held in solution or lie in bottom sediments.
They become available to animal life after being
absorbed by plants, both large floating or rooted plants and
tiny floating ones called phytoplankton; because the phytoplankton
are found everywhere in the sea, they play a larger
role. The phytoplankton concentrate minerals and become
food for filter-feeding fish and other creatures, including
the smaller zooplankton,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> which, in turn, are food for other
organisms. Thus the minerals enter extremely complex
food chains. The cycles of nutrition are completed when
fish and plants die and decomposition again makes the
minerals available to the phytoplankton.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Some radionuclides that are introduced into an aquatic
environment enter the food chains exactly as do the stable
minerals essential to life, because the radionuclides are
merely radioactive forms of the nutrients. Elements such
as copper, zinc, and iron are less plentiful in the water
environment than hydrogen, carbon, or oxygen, for example,
but are concentrated by phytoplankton because they are
necessary for life. Such elements are in short supply but in
constant demand; thus, when their radioactive forms are
deposited in water, they are immediately taken up by
aquatic plants and begin to move through the food chains.
Fission products such as strontium-90, for which there is
little or no metabolic demand, are taken up by aquatic food
chains to only a minor extent.</p>
<p>The precise paths of radioelements through aquatic ecosystems
are almost unknown. In addition to their movement
in food chains, radioelements also may be moved
physically from place to place in the tissues of fish or other
creatures. Some radionuclides for which there is no biological
demand may sink into bottom sediments and remain
there until they have lost their radioactivity. Or radioactivity
actually may be transported &ldquo;uphill&rdquo;, from water
to land, as when birds that feed on fish containing radioactivity
leave their excretions at nesting areas. The routes
and modes of transport seem numberless.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h4>The Oceans</h4>
<p>The surface waters of the seas, down to
depths of 200 meters, are areas of rapid mixing in which
temperature, density, and salinity are almost uniform. Below
the surface water is a zone in which temperature decreases
and density and salinity increase with depth. This
zone, known as the thermocline, may reach a depth of 1000
meters. Because density is increasing here, vertical motion
is reduced, and exchanges between the surface and the deep
waters are impeded. Knowledge of temperature, density,
and salinity is important to understanding what happens to
radionuclides in the ocean. Physical conditions affect the
rates of physical movement of radioactivity in the mixed
(surface) layer, the degree to which radionuclides are held
at the thermocline, and the processes by which radionuclides
pass the thermocline and enter the deep-water cycles
and upwellings.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Men aboard the research vessel</i> Shimada <i>pulling in plankton nets

</div>
<p>The surface currents of the ocean are largely wind
driven and their patterns generally well known. New concepts
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
of the vertical and horizontal diffusion of substances
introduced into the ocean were developed, however, in
studies of ocean-borne fallout during and after nuclear
tests in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The first of these surveys was conducted near Eniwetok
and Bikini. Scientists aboard a Navy vessel sampled water
and plankton to depths of 300 meters at some 90 points
spread over an area of 78,000 square miles to determine
the disposition of early fallout from the nuclear detonations.
Some weeks later another expedition voyaged from Eniwetok
to Guam and returned, covering an area of 375,000
square miles to follow (by sampling) the mass of water-borne
radioactivity resulting from the test and to note the
intervening effects of diffusion, dilution, biological uptake,
and decay. In 1958 two more surveys were conducted, the
first to ascertain the spread and depth&mdash;with samplings
below the thermocline&mdash;of a radioactively tagged water
mass immediately following an underwater detonation, and
the second to follow the westward drift of the tagged water
mass.</p>
<p>Significantly, it was found that plankton immediately take
up large amounts of radioactivity. Planktonic forms, in
fact, proved to be the most sensitive indicators of the presence
of radioactivity in the marine environment. Further,
the daily vertical migrations of plankton&mdash;down in response
to sunlight and up at night&mdash;seemed a part of the process
by which radionuclides move from the upper waters to the
deeps.</p>
<p>The expedition scientists noted that the masses of low-level
radioactivity moved in the ocean significantly slower
than the surface currents, a circumstance attributable in
large measure to biological factors. The distribution of
residual radioactivity in the sea a month after the close of
a nuclear testing program could be determined by counting
radioactivity in plankton samples.</p>
<p>It was established that strontium-90 and cesium-137,
important in fallout on land, enter the marine cycles only
in minute amounts. Practically no fission products are
found in fish. Since strontium-90 is not concentrated
strongly by marine organisms, the question of what happens
to it in the ocean remains unanswered. Studies have suggested,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
however, that strontium moves in solution and thus
indicates the movement of water. If this is true, strontium-90
may be contained in the deep currents and eventually
will be brought again to the surface. Some observers believe
this process has begun.</p>
<h4>Rivers, Lakes, and Estuaries</h4>
<p>The freshwater environment
differs from the marine in the greater variety of its minerals,
among other things. As sites for radiobiological
studies, rivers and lakes present problems of great complexity,
but conditions at river mouths or estuaries are
even more difficult because of the mixing by tidal action of
fresh and salt water.</p>
<p>Rivers vary greatly in character and change radically
from season to season because of rainfall and other factors.
General understanding of their biological workings is
difficult to formulate. But rivers are the routes by which
minerals and wastes are transported toward the sea, and
estuaries are significant because of the many forms of life
that flourish there.</p>
<p>Studies of radioactivity in rivers and estuaries usually
have been made in relation to the fate of effluents from nuclear
plants. Among the longest and most intensive studies
are those near Hanford, Washington. Observations were
started in 1943, when the federal government was preparing
to build plutonium-producing reactors to be cooled by
waters of the Columbia River.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_35">

<p class="caption small"><i>Fisheries biologists

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>For more than two decades, observations have been made
of the physical dispersion and biological disposition of low-level
effluents in the Columbia. Concentration factors have
been established for significant radionuclides in phytoplankton,
algae, insects, and fish, and typical patterns of
dilution and dispersion have been plotted.</p>
<p>Similar programs, in an entirely different freshwater
system, have been conducted over a similar span of years
near the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. One
area of interest has been the biological disposition of trace
amounts of strontium-90 released to the Tennessee River
via tributary streams.</p>
<p>Among the few broad estuarial studies yet undertaken is
one started in 1961 to plot the dissemination in the lower
Columbia River, and in the Pacific Ocean, of radioisotopes
transported by the river from the Hanford plant. Radiobiologists
are studying biological distribution. Oceanographers
are using the trace amounts of effluent radioactivity to
verify the patterns of dispersion of river waters in the
ocean.</p>
<h3>Land</h3>
<div class="img" id="pic_36">
<img src="images/p039.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="451" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Plant ecologists &ldquo;tagging&rdquo; experimental

</div>
<p>Natural radionuclides find their way into plants&rsquo; metabolic
processes. Man-made radionuclides also are so
incorporated&mdash;even some, such as uranium or radium,
that have no known metabolic role. The man-made nuclides,
whether they reach the earth in fallout or by other means,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
mix with the stable nuclides to which they are chemically
related, increasing by small fractions the total amount of
each element available to participate in plant growth cycles.
Because artificial radionuclides behave so typically, they
present, on the one hand, a possible long-term hazard and,
on the other, the expectation that their detectability will
reveal much about the biological courses of minerals and
nutrients.</p>
<p>The disposition of man-made radioactivity on land is
determined in part by such factors as topography and the
presence or absence of water. Topography may influence
the distribution by setting patterns of drainage and exposure
of surface soils to wind and rain. Water may affect
dilution, or it may leach radionuclides out of surface soils
and thus remove them from the level in which plants are
rooted. The leaching may carry radionuclides elsewhere,
however, possibly causing mild contamination of the water
table.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_37">
<img src="images/p040.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="522" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Trench dug on Rongelap Island to expose soil strata and root systems

</div>
<p>Plants take up radionuclides through their roots or
through their foliage. But the role of soils is significant.
Some radionuclides are bound as ions to clays and thus are
withheld in large measure from entry into the plant system.
Cesium-137, for example, is held so tightly by soils that
uptake through plant roots is slight, and thus a more significant
mode of entry of cesium-137 into food chains is by
direct deposit on plant leaves. Variables are introduced by
the physical configuration of the plant itself, by seasonal
differences in plant metabolism, and by the effects of rain
and snow. In the case of iodine-131, a short half-life&mdash;8
days&mdash;virtually precludes the possibility of extensive uptake
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
through plant roots. But the half-life is not too short
to prevent grazing cattle from ingesting radioiodine deposited
in fallout and thus allow the appearance of radioiodine
in milk.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_38">
<img src="images/p041.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="513" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Survey of pasture grasses to determine whether radioactive
materials are present. If they are, they could be passed from the
grasses to cows and then from the cows&rsquo; milk to humans.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Much attention has been devoted to strontium-90 and to
its availability to man by deposit on plants and soils. Because
strontium bears a close chemical relation to calcium,
a unit expressing this relation, the <i>strontium unit</i> (one picocurie<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
[1 &times; 10<sup>-12</sup> curie of strontium-90 per gram of calcium])
is used in following strontium-90 through food
chains. Soils, however, present confusing factors. Experiments
and fallout observations show that strontium-90
does not penetrate soils deeply. In typical instances it
remains in the upper inch or two of the soil surface, where
its availability to root systems is as variable as the conditions
of mixing, leaching, and plant growth. Experiments
have shown that plant uptake of strontium from soils can
be reduced by introduction of calcium in available form into
the soil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Radiobiological developments on land result from combinations
of environmental influences. Studies in the Rocky
Mountains show that ecological conditions above the timberline,
particularly in areas where snowbanks accumulate,
are efficient in concentrating fallout radionuclides. Concentrations
thus take place in the snow-packed heights that are
the sources of mountain streams flowing to the plains far
below.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The environment of the earth is a product of &ldquo;weather&rdquo;&mdash;of
the transport of moisture, of the actions between winds
and oceans, of the cycling of energy through biotic systems.
Understanding of biological potentials of atmospheric
factors involves understanding of atmospheric motions affecting
transport and mixing of contaminants and the processes
of deposition of radionuclides from atmosphere to
earth.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_39">
<img src="images/p042.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="611" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Network of towers on the Atomic Energy Commission

</div>
<p>At some thousands of feet above the earth&rsquo;s surface&mdash;at
30,000 to 40,000 feet in the middle and polar latitudes and
at 50,000 to 60,000 feet in the tropics&mdash;there is a level, the
tropopause, at which air temperature, rather than decreasing,
becomes constant or increases with height. Below this
level is the troposphere, the turbulent zone of clouds, rain,
and fog. Above it is the stratosphere, where there is no
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
turbulence and only a slow mixing of dry and cloudless air.
The stratosphere continues to a height of about 100,000
feet. Investigators have noted the importance of rain or
snow in washing fallout particles from the air in the troposphere.
There is disagreement on the precise modes of
distribution of radioactive materials projected into the
stratosphere.</p>
<p>In the detonation of low-yield nuclear devices, fission
products are not projected beyond the troposphere, and
fallout is washed down in periods of days or weeks. Because
winds move principally in east-west directions, tropospheric
fallout appears on the earth in bands centered approximately
at the latitude of detonation. But when high-yield
explosions propel contaminants into the stratosphere,
the pattern of subsequent developments is less clear. It
once was believed that fallout from the stratosphere was
distributed more or less evenly&mdash;though over long periods
of time&mdash;over the surface of the earth. The present view is
that fallout debris placed in the stratosphere remains in
that hemisphere in which the explosion occurs. This concept
is based on an atmospheric circulation theory that air
enters the stratosphere at the equator and descends again
in temperate and polar latitudes each spring. The theory
presumes a much shorter &ldquo;residence time&rdquo; of stratospheric
air and thus a quicker return of fallout particles to
the turbulent troposphere.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The presence of radionuclides in the atmosphere has
provided clues to cyclical movements of biological importance.
During the period of nuclear tests in the Pacific,
observers noted spring &ldquo;pulses&rdquo;, or increases, of strontium-90
deposition in the northern hemisphere, a phenomenon
difficult to verify or explain satisfactorily while
testing was proceeding. Later, when testing had been suspended,
the spring peaks reappeared. The observation
seemed to support the theory that nuclear debris injected
into the stratosphere was descending years later through a
gap in the tropopause.</p>
<p>Samplings of nuclear debris by balloon have been under
way for several years at altitudes of 100,000 to 150,000
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
feet, and rocket-borne air samplers and other systems have
been developed for taking atmospheric samples up to
200,000 feet.</p>
<p>Programs for studying airborne contamination from industrial
activities&mdash;operated at the more accessible but
equally difficult levels of the atmosphere&mdash;have been
sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission near the
Hanford Plant, Washington, and at the Oak Ridge, Argonne,
and Brookhaven National Laboratories in Tennessee, Illinois,
and New York. The Hanford studies were started
before plutonium production was begun in 1943, and findings
on industrial stack-discharge rates established patterns
for meteorological programs at other sites.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<h2 id="c6">PROBLEMS AND PROJECTS</h2>
<p>The range and variety of environmental studies now in
progress make it almost impossible to provide any all-encompassing
statement of results. Almost all places associated
with nuclear programs have become focal points
of research in environmental biology. Fallout, deposited in
patterns determined by the mechanisms of the atmosphere,
has created at certain points on the earth&rsquo;s surface&mdash;the
Arctic, for example&mdash;ecological conditions that require investigation.
New information of bioenvironmental significance
has come in bits and fragments. We can, however,
attempt to summarize what has been learned and to show,
in broad terms, how radiobiological experience has extended
appreciation of the earth as a single ecosystem&mdash;a
system comprised of an infinity of interactions of water,
land, and atmosphere, and of all living things.</p>
<p>The spectrum of environmental investigation&mdash;investigations
using man-made radioactivity&mdash;incorporates research
in which:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Fallout radioactivity is assessed as a potential specific
hazard to human populations.</p>
<p>2. Conditions created by fallout are examined for their
potential long-term ecological significance.</p>
<p>3. Radionuclides introduced into the environment by nuclear
tests, reactor operations, or other means are
used as trace materials in basic studies in biological
systems.</p>
<p>4. Radioactive forms of minerals and nutrients are deliberately
introduced into biosystems&mdash;in measured
amounts and under conditions of control&mdash;for studies
of metabolic cycles and rates of flow of energy and
nutrition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be useful to look in detail at some typical programs
and results.</p>

<h3>Wasps and Radioactive Mud</h3>
<p>At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, it was
discovered in 1964 that two kinds of mud-dauber wasps
were building their mud nests in equipment, cabinets, and
electronic gear in the vicinity of a field station on the
Oak Ridge reservation.</p>
<p>Some nests, investigation disclosed, were built of radioactive
mud. It seemed obvious that the wasps were obtaining
mud from radioactive waste pits or from the White
Oak Lake bed, which is the site of a former 40-acre lake
used for 12 years as a detention pool for radioactive
wastes.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The mud daubers were carrying mud as far as 650 feet
from the contaminated sources. Almost 90% of 112 nests
built by the yellow-legged mud-dauber species were radioactive,
and the mud was delivering to the wasp eggs each
hour a dose of penetrating radiation equal to that received
by a man from all natural sources over a period of many
years. The development presented no human health problems,
but further observation revealed a fascinating circumstance.</p>
<p>At the same time, another variety of wasp, the pipe-organ
mud dauber, was building nests only of <i>non</i>radioactive
mud. Of 150 pipe-organ wasp nests examined, none
was radioactive. The nests were found in similar locations,
and it was apparent that the same sources of nest
materials were available to both species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h4>WASP NEST RESEARCH</h4>

<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The question, then, was why wasps of one species were
using radioactive mud while the other species seemingly
discriminated against contaminated mud. The muds appeared
to be entirely alike. X-ray-diffraction studies
showed no material differences, nor were there detectable
differences in &ldquo;feel&rdquo;, smell, or plasticity. Radioactive isotopes
in the mud included cesium-137, cobalt-60, ruthenium-106,
and zinc-65. Oak Ridge scientists began to try to find
out whether the pipe-organ wasps actually were discriminating
against muds containing all or some of these radioisotopes
or against the ionizing radiation from them. If
so, how could the wasps detect it? These investigations
were continuing in 1965. There is no answer yet.</p>
<h3>Survival of an Animal Population</h3>
<p>The case of Bikini already has been discussed as an example
of a predominantly aquatic environment apparently
recovering from association with nuclear experiment.
Eniwetok offers an instance of the toughness of an animal
population exposed both to direct and long-range radiological
impact.</p>
<p>Engebi Island, on Eniwetok&rsquo;s northeast reef, is the home
of a wholly self-contained colony of Pacific rats living in a
network of burrows in the shallow coral sands. After 1948
Engebi was exposed repeatedly to atomic detonations, and
in 1952 the whole island was swept clean of growth and
overwashed by waves from the thermonuclear explosion of
Operation Ivy. On each of these occasions, exposure of the
rat colony to radiation was intense. In 1952, by later estimates,
the animals aboveground received radiation doses
of 2500 to 6000 roentgens per hour, and those in burrows
doses of 112 to 1112 roentgens per hour.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> The island environment
was so altered by atomic forces and by contaminated
water that radiobiologists believed it impossible
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
that any of the rats had survived. Because there was no
natural route by which the island could be repopulated,
scientists even considered introducing a new rat colony for
study of a population growth in a mildly radioactive environment.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_46">
<img src="images/p053.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="325" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Engebi Island, Eniwetok Atoll, home of a colony of rats living in

</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_47">
<img src="images/p054.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="287" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Close-up shows one burrow in the soil.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Contrary to all expectations, however, the original colony
had not been eliminated. Biologists visiting Engebi in 1953
and 1954 found the rats apparently flourishing. New generations
of rats were being born and were subsisting on
grasses and other plants in an environment still slightly
radioactive. In 1955 analysis of the bones of rats revealed
the presence of strontium-89 and strontium-90 in amounts
approaching what was assumed to be the maximum amount
that would not cause bodily harm. The rats&rsquo; muscle tissues
contained radioactive cesium-137. But no physical malformations
were found in the rats. All animals appeared in
sound physical condition, despite these body burdens of
radioactivity. By 1964 the rat population had so increased
that it apparently had reached equilibrium with available
food supplies.</p>
<p>Questions relating to the reestablishment of the colony
are intriguing. Why are new generations of these warm-blooded
animals continuing to thrive after the colony was
exposed to devastating nuclear effects? Is there a different
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
dose-effect relation for these rats than for other animals?
Even if it is assumed, as it must be, that some members of
the colony survived the original nuclear heat and radioactivity
because they were shielded by concrete bunkers or
other man-made structures, how is it that there have been
no observable effects among rats existing for years in an
area that continually exposed them to radiation?</p>

</div>
<h3>Fallout and Populations</h3>
<p>In Arctic regions lying on opposite sides of the North
Pole, fallout has created conditions that are given continuous
scrutiny by scientists of Scandinavia and the United
States.</p>
<p>The two cases, one involving the Lapps of northern Finland
and the other the Eskimos of Alaska, are essentially
the same. Hemispheric fallout introduced quantities of long-lived
radionuclides, particularly cesium-137, into the food
chains and consequently into the diets of native peoples. In
each instance there had occurred a slow accumulation of
radionuclides in the lichens and mosses and in other plants
that are the foods of the reindeer and caribou. The meat of
these animals forms a substantial part of the human diets,
and as a result the members of the native communities
were found to have, on the average, body burdens of radioactivity
approaching the acceptable limit for human populations.</p>
<p>A preliminary study of the Lapp environment was made
in 1958-1959, and a Lapp dietary study was made in 1960.
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
The results showed close correlation between the consumption
of reindeer meat and the Lapps&rsquo; body burdens of cesium-137.
The Scandinavian investigators concluded that the
levels of concentrated cesium approximated the maximum
permissible dose range for large populations. They noted,
however, that &ldquo;the final answer ... has to be given by the
geneticists&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_49">
<img src="images/p056.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="391" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Placing equipment to measure fallout in
precipitation north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In Alaska, where studies of the native populations have
been proceeding for several years, adult Eskimos living in
the vicinity of Anaktuvuk Pass<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> were found in 1964 to have
average body burdens of cesium-137 more than 20 times as
great as the average for adults in the area of the original
48 states. There was an expectation that even without further
nuclear testing the levels of cesium-137 would continue
to rise slowly in Arctic regions until about 1968.</p>
<h3>The Variety of Approaches</h3>
<p>Bioenvironmental studies form a background against
which all atomic energy research is conducted. The central
objective of the Atomic Energy Commission&rsquo;s environmental
radiation studies is &ldquo;to determine the fate and effect
of radionuclides in the environment&rdquo;. This objective calls
for hundreds of concurrent approaches to the interlocking
problems of the air, the sea, and the land. The AEC alone,
through its Division of Biology and Medicine, is supporting
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
research costing about $75 million a year, about two-thirds
of this amount going to biological and medical programs at
AEC laboratories and the remainder to some 650 individual
contract studies at universities, nonprofit institutions, and
commercial research organizations. Additional programs,
large and small, are supported by foundations or other
agencies. Work goes on in other nations. Many programs
are international. Although only a fraction of this total activity
is specifically related to environmental problems,
the concern throughout is with the effect, for good or ill,
of radioactivity on man and his world. It is possible to suggest
by example the lines of inquiry.</p>

</div>
<p>The Trinity site in New Mexico, scene of the first atomic
detonation in history, was studied for a number of years
after 1945, particularly in relation to the distribution and
effects of residual radioactivity in the desert environment.
In 1963 and 1964 scientists from the University of Missouri
undertook to determine the state of revegetation of
the original atomic bomb crater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The Nevada Test Site, where nuclear programs have
been conducted for a decade and a half, has invited investigations
of revegetation. Project Sedan, an underground
thermonuclear detonation in 1962, established conditions
for one such study. The crater produced by this detonation
was 320 feet deep and 1200 feet in diameter. Vegetation
growing within 2500 feet of ground zero was almost completely
destroyed, and the original soil was covered by
radioactive throwout. Shrubs as far as 5000 feet away from
ground zero were damaged by air blast, and, in the weeks
after the detonation, plants within a two-mile radius were
covered by radioactive sand and silt or by deposits of windblown
radioactive dust.</p>
<p>Studies in 1963 by scientists from the University of
California at Los Angeles showed that native plants&mdash;Russian
thistle and various annuals&mdash;had become well established
in the zone around the Sedan crater where the earth
was thrown out. This area had remained barren for less
than a year. Some of the shrubs most severely damaged
by the blast, and exposed to cumulative gamma radiation
doses of more than 4000 roentgens, had produced new
growth. Populations of creosote bush, evergreen plants
that in 1962 appeared to have been killed by heavy doses of
radiation, were producing leafy branches in the summer of
1963. These developments permitted no conclusions, of
course, for the possible radiation effects still needed to be
identified. Studies were conducted, for example, of the
effect of deliberately depositing nonradioactive dust on
healthy creosote plants, and comparative studies of other
phenomena were made.</p>
<p>Since 1959, ecological studies have been carried forward
at the Nevada site by investigators from Brigham Young
University who are interested in the abundance, seasonal
occurrence, and ecological influences affecting the vertebrate
and invertebrate animals in plant communities of the
region. Surveys have been made in areas where nuclear
explosions had obliterated natural ecological relationships
and in similar areas undisturbed by nuclear effects.
The investigations are concerned primarily with desert
ecology&mdash;with the identification of biotic communities and
of predominant animal species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Among research programs in marine environments is
that initiated in 1963 and 1964 by the University of California&rsquo;s
Institute of Marine Resources at La Jolla, where
studies of marine food chains are conducted by a team of
zoologists, chemists, botanists, and microbiologists. The
program studies the interrelations among organisms at the
lower levels of the food chains and the dynamics of marine
phytoplankton cell division, photosynthesis, and excretion
of organic matter as related to temperature, light intensity,
and nutrient conditions. The work is conceived as a
basic study of marine ecology. It is focused, however, on
questions found to be significant in studies of radioactivity
in the sea.</p>
<p>The University of California&rsquo;s Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
has launched a long-term investigation of the effects
of the release of radionuclides on the biosphere,
which encompasses the origins, transport, and final localization
of radionuclides in all types of organs, tissues,
cells, and subcellular constituents. The objective is &ldquo;to
develop the most complete understanding possible of the
potential hazards to man that arise from the release of
nuclear radiation and radionuclides into the biosphere and
to apply this knowledge to the prevention of damage to
living forms...&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In programs such as these&mdash;multiplied by hundreds&mdash;the
problems are being attacked.</p>
<h2 id="c7">WHERE ARE WE NOW?</h2>
<p>Radiobiological studies that are environmental in scope
became, with the release of atomic energy, a mandate on
the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Environmental studies are not new. They have been implicit
in thousands of biological research efforts, large
and small, for generations. Atomic energy, however, is a
new factor. Also new is the intensity of the approach. Not
until the explosion of inquiry of this century has man
brought together the necessary resources&mdash;the time, the
funds, the instruments, the ingenious technological devices,
the ideas, and the organizational and management
skills&mdash;to attack problems that are global in scale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The atom as a tool of the environmental radiobiologist
has, of itself, solved few problems. Its significance is that
it has speeded up&mdash;to a degree still not fully tested&mdash;our
ability to study ecosystems and their relations to each
other.</p>

<p>The first two decades of the Atomic Age have comprised
a period of swift maturity. Much has been done to gain
perspective. Atomic energy as a potential force for destruction
has not been controlled. But there is a surer
knowledge of the hazard inherent in the absence of control
and a rational hope that the new power will be directed
toward peaceful objectives. We know that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The uninhibited release of nuclear products into the
environment of the earth will create problems&mdash;fundamentally
biological problems&mdash;of long duration and
of still-unassessed ultimate effect.</p>
<p>2. Use of atomic weapons in war could have a &ldquo;biological
cost&rdquo; beyond calculation.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Yet, in terms of constructive employment of atomic
resources, we also know that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Atomic energy may help solve the very problems that
the new age presents.</p>
<p>2. Careful and controlled development of atomic forces
will provide the reservoirs of energy that will be
needed to sustain the world&rsquo;s populations of the next
century and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In whatever case, the solutions lie in the direction of
environmental knowledge.</p>
<p>Man, the human animal, will live in the environment he
has the intelligence to understand and to preserve.</p>
